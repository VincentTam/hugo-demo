Minimal site created for Hugo, a static site generator

This is a bare markdown site (see https://github.com/arocks/minimal-hugo and https://arunrocks.com/minimal-hugo-site-tutorial)
smashed together with a minimal <a href="https://themes.gohugo.io/reveal-hugo/">reveal-hugo</a> presentation.

Thanks to <a href="https://www.jakewiesler.com/blog/hugo-directory-structure/">Hugo's Directory Structure Explained</a>
for its explanation of how Hugo and its content types work.  Hugo's official doc seems to focus on trees, but Jake's post helped me see the forest.
